add_spread:
    description: |
        Spread measures the difference between the high and low price.
        Large spreads indicate high intraday volatility and uncertainty.
        Small spreads suggest stable trading and low volatility.
        Wide spreads can signal potential breakout conditions or heightened risk. Narrow spreads often occur during consolidation phases.
add_price_change:
    description: |
        Price Change tracks the difference between the current price and a previous price.
        Positive values show upward momentum.
        Negative values show downward momentum.
        Large changes may indicate strong trends or potential reversals
add_relative_spread:
    description: |
        Relative Spread normalizes the daily spread by dividing it by the closing price.
        High relative spread means the day’s price range was large compared to the closing level, signaling volatility.
        Low relative spread means the day’s price range was small relative to the close, signaling stability.
        Use relative spread to compare volatility across different assets or timeframes, since it adjusts for price scale.
add_returns:
    description: |
        Rolling Returns measure the average percentage change in price over a moving window.
        Consistently positive rolling returns indicate sustained upward performance over the chosen period.
        Consistently negative rolling returns indicate sustained downward performance.
        Sharp swings in rolling returns highlight unstable performance and potential regime shifts.
        Use rolling returns to evaluate whether gains/losses are persistent or just short-term noise.
add_log_returns:
    description: |
        Positive log return → price increased relative to prior period.
        Negative log return → price decreased.
        Large absolute log return → high volatility or unusual price movement.
        Rolling log returns → highlight persistence of gains/losses and help detect regime shifts.
add_Simple_Moving_Average:
    description: |
        SMA smooths price data by averaging over a set period.
        Price above SMA suggests bullish trend.
        Price below SMA suggests bearish trend.
        Longer SMAs show long-term trends; shorter SMAs highlight short-term moves.
        Check corssections of different SMA periods.
add_rolling_volume:
    description: |
        Rolling Volume tracks average trading volume over a moving window.
        Increasing rolling volume signals growing interest or momentum.
        Decreasing rolling volume suggests fading participation.
add_rolling_volume_zscore:
    description: |
        Rolling Volume Z-Score standardizes volume relative to its mean.
        High positive scores indicate unusually high volume (possible breakout).
        Low negative scores indicate unusually low volume (possible consolidation).
        Useful for spotting abnormal trading activity
add_momentum:
    description: |
        Momentum measures the speed of price changes.
        High momentum suggests strong trend continuation.
        Low or negative momentum suggests weakening trend or reversal.
        Often used to confirm strength of rallies or declines
add_rate_of_change:
    description: |
        ROC measures percentage change in price compared to past periods.
        Positive ROC indicates upward momentum.
        Negative ROC indicates downward momentum.
        Extreme values may signal overbought or oversold conditions
add_rolling_volatility:
    description: |
        Rolling Volatility measures variability of returns over a moving window.
        High volatility signals risk and potential large price swings.
        Low volatility suggests stability and reduced trading opportunities.
        Useful for risk management and timing entries/exits
add_rolling_Exponentional_Moving_Averages:
    description: |
        EMA emphasizes recent prices more than older ones.
        Price above EMA suggests bullish momentum.
        Price below EMA suggests bearish momentum.
        Rolling EMAs adapt quickly to market changes, making them ideal for short-term trading
add_MACD:
    description: |
        Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) compares short-term and long-term momentum.
        Crossovers between MACD and the signal line are often used to identify trend changes.
add_RSI:
    description: |
        Relative Strength Index (RSI) measures momentum.
        Values above 70 often indicate overbought conditions.
        Values below 30 often indicate oversold conditions.
        Overbought conditions indicate that ticker rose too quickly and there might be price pullback or reversal. Indicator of potential sale oportunity.
        Oversold conditions indicate that ticker has fallen too quickly and there might be upward price reversal. Indicator of potential buy oportunity.
add_std:
    description: |
        Shows spread of close value from their average over set period.
        High values indicate high volatility and risk (5-10)
        Low values indicate low volatility and risk (1-2)
general_description:
    description: |
        This metric is highly dependant on ticker internal situation and general marcet and cant be evaluated as single purpuse indicator.
